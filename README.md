A module for working with the Seneye range of aquarium and pond sensors. Support is provided for the HID/USB driver for the device although it is intended to add support for their API later.

When using this, readings will not be synced to the Seneye.me cloud service. This module is in no way endorsed by Seneye and you use it at your own risk.

Generated documentation can be found [here](http://pyseneye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Quickstart
----------

Install pyseneye using `pip`: `$ pip install pyseneye`. Once that is complete you can import the SUDevice class and connect to your device.

```python
>>> from pyseneye.sud import SUDevice, Action
>>> d = SUDevice()
```

Once the class is initialised you can put the Seneye into interactive mode and then retrieve sensor readings.

```python
>>> d.action(Action.ENTER_INTERACTIVE_MODE)
>>> s = d.action(Action.SENSOR_READING)
>>> s.ph
8.16
>>> s.nh3
0.007
>>> s.temperature
25.125
>>> d.action(Action.LEAVE_INTERACTIVE_MODE)
>>> d.close()
```

You need access to the USB device, so these calls may require elevated privileges.
